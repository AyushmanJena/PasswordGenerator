TODO :

In the beginning  :
=====================
1. A option that will auto generate a password and wont ask for any constraints.
Will give the password with length 8 and with all types of characters.
2. OR customize the password constraints.



After the password is generated 'Two Options :
==============================================
1. Option if the user wants to save the password or not. will follow with app and id 
Restart the process :
It will again ask if you want numbers, alphabets, length , etc
Regenerate :
Only creates another password with the same constraints.

Asks :
Enter account for which the password is : 
Enter ID : 

Enter Length ?
Include Alphabets ?
Include Numbers ?
Include Special Symbols ?
Symbols to include ?

Gives Password :
Type 'r' to regenerate 
else 's' to save the acc, id and pass into a txt document



STEP 2 :
=========
Make it GUI

STEP 3 :
=========
Encrypt the text file.'

Encryption Idea :
Txt file : 
This is an example of txt file

set master Password : 
28824

do some operation with the master password and generate another single digit number
which will change the text of the txt file

Then when the user gives the same master Password then only you will be able to see the original txt in the gui window or console
