In the beginning  : 
=====================
1. A option that will auto generate a password and wont ask for any constraints.
Will give the password with length 8 and with all types of characters.
2. OR customize the password constraints.



After the password is generated 'Two Options :
==============================================
1. Option if the user wants to save the password or not. will follow with app and id 
Restart the process :
It will again ask if you want numbers, alphabets, length , etc
Regenerate :
Only creates another password with the same constraints.


IMP : Make it so that it must include a digit and special symbol

HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE : 
==========================
Instead of having a string 'chars' to store all the chars 
Make a 2d array 
rows will increase if user opts for number, symbol types
Make sure the password has characters from each row.
Store the password in an array of characters instead of string.

IS_STRONG() :
It checks if the generated password has characters as per the constraints given by user.
Ans utilizes all the possible types of characters as user wants.

imp : Might need to make it object based with data members being : 
len, includeAlpha, includeDig, includeSymb



Asks :
Enter account for which the password is : 
Enter ID : 

Enter Length ?
Include Alphabets ?
Include Numbers ?
Include Special Symbols ?
Symbols to include ?

Gives Password :
Type 'r' to regenerate 
else 's' to save the acc, id and pass into a txt document



STEP 2 :
=========
Make it GUI

STEP 3 :
=========
Encrypt the text file.'
